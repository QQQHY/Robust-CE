About CFAI(Counterfactual Explanation for Artificial Intelligence)
================================

Counterfactual explanations mainly target to find the mimimum perturbation which changes the original prediction(Ususlly from an undesirable prediction to ideal one). The perturbation itself is a valid instance following the real data distribution as the training samples. It has broad applications, E.g., finance, education, health care ect. Specifically, what should I do to get the credit card approved if I received the rejection. 

This project will cover some interesting and useful algorithms, mostly on Pytorch platform. 

.. note::

    This project is under construction. Hope it come soon!
