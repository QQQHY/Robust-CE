About Counterfacutal Explanations (Pytorch)
================================

Counterfactual explanations mainly target to find an explanation of a given instance, such that the explanation can change the prediction(Ususally from an undesirable outcome to an ideal one). The explanation itself is also a valid instance, or changing of current instance(can reduce to another instance implicitly) in the feature space. It has broad applications, E.g., finance, education etc.
