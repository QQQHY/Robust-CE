#About Counterfacutal Explanations (Pytorch)

Counterfactual explanations mainly target to find an explanation of a given instance, such that the explanation can change the prediction(Ususally from an undesirable outcome to an ideal one). The explanation itself is also a valid instance, or changing of current instance(can reduce to another instance implicitly) in the feature space. It has broad applications, E.g., finance, education etc.

This task is popular recently. However, I cannot find any released repository on Pytorch platform. Hence, I create this project and plan to implement some algorithm continously. 
I appreciate it very much if anyone can contribute to this project together with me.  For the implementation details, I am glad to discuss with all of you together.

A collection of methods on counterfactual explanation I plan to add into this repository. Continously updating.
